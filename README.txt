My game is called Coin Pirate. The goal of the game is to get as much gold as you can. Each coin is either worth 30 or 60 points, but they are indistinguishable. You are also fighting the enemy of black balls. They will emerge from the right side  of the screen, and if they collide with you, then the game is over. If they hit a coin, that coin will disappear. 
The controls for the game follow:

DODGE THE BLACK BALLS!
To go back to the main screen, you can always press Select to go back.
